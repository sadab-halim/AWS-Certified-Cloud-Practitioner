### What is a Cloud Architect?
A solutions architect that is focused solely on architecting technical solutions using cloud sevices.

A cloud architect need to understand the following terms and factor them into their designed architecture based on the business requirements.
- **Availability** : Your ability to ensure a service remains available eg. **Highly Available (HA)**
- **Scalability** : Your abilityy to grow rapidly or unimpeded
- **Elasticity** : Your ability to shrink and grow to meet the demand
- **Fault Tolerance** : Your ability to prevent a failure
- **Disaster Recovery** : Your ability to recover from a failure eg. **Highly Durable (DR)**  

A Solutions Architect needs to always consider the following business factors:
- (Security) How secure is this solution?
- (Cost) How much is this going to cost?
