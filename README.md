# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- A web service for **securely controlling access** to AWS services
- centrally **manage** users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.

### IAM: Users & Groups
- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

### IAM: Permissions
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called **policies**
- These policies define the *permissions* of the users
- In AWS you *apply the least privilege principle*: don’t give more permissions than a user needs

### IAM Policies Structure
- Consists of:
    - **Version**: policy language version, always include “2012-10-17”
    - **Id**: an identifier for the policy (optional)
    - **Statement**: one or more individual statements (required)
- Statements consists of:
    - **Sid**: an identifier for the statement (optional)
    - **Effect**: whether the statement allows or denies access *(Allow, Deny)*
    - **Principal**: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    - **Action**: list of actions this policy allows or denies
    - **Resource**: list of resources to which the actions applied to
    - **Condition**: conditions for when this policy is in effect
(optional)

### IAM: Password Policy
- Strong passwords = higher security for your account
- In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
    - Set a minimum password length
    - Require specific character types:
        - including uppercase letters
        - lowercase letters
        - numbers
        - non-alphanumeric characters
    - Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
    - Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
    - Prevent password re-use

### IAM Roles for Services
- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will *assign permissions* to AWS services
with IAM Roles
- Common roles:
    - EC2 Instance Roles
    - Lambda Function Roles
    - Roles for CloudFormation


### IAM Security Tools
- **IAM Credentials Report** *(account-level)*
    -  a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
- **IAM Access Advisor** *(user-level)*
    - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
    - You can use this information to revise your policies.

### IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
- Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM
Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

### Shared Responsibility Model for IAM
| AWS | User |
| --- | ---- |
| Infrastructure (global network security) | Users, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring |
| Configuration and vulnerability analysis | Enable MFA on all accounts |
| Compliance validation | Rotate all your keys often |
| | Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions |
| | Analyze access patterns & review permissions |


# AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On)
- One Login (SSO) for all your AWS accounts in AWS Organizatios
- It provides one place where you can *create* or *connect workforce users* and centrally *manage their access* to **all** of their **AWS accounts** and **applications**.

# Amazon Inspector
- Automated and Continual **vulnerability management** at scale
- Run variety of security benchmarks, can perform both network and host assessments
- For EC2 instances
    - Leveraging the AWS System Manager (SSM) agent
    - Analyze against unintended network accessibility
    - Analyze the running OS against known vulnerabilities
- For Container Images push to Amazon ECR
    - Assessment of Container Images as they are pushed
- For Lambda Functions
    - Identifies software vulnerabilities in function code and package dependencies
    - Assessment of functions as they are deployed
- Reporting & Integration with AWS Security Hub
- Send findings to Amazon Event Bridge

### What does Amazon Inspector evaluate?
- **Remember**: only for EC2 instances, Container Images & Lambda functions
- Continuous scanning of the infrastructure, only when needed
- Package vulnerabilities (EC2, ECR & Lambda) – database of CVE
- Network reachability (EC2)
- A risk score is associated with all vulnerabilities for prioritization

# AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
- KMS stands for Key Management Service
- Managed creation and control of **encryption** keys
- *Anytime you hear **“encryption”** for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS*
- KMS = AWS manages the encryption key for us
- Encryption Opt-in:
    - EBS volumes: encrypt volumes
    - S3 buckets: Server-side encryption of objects
    - Redshift database: encryption of data
    - RDS database: encryption of data
    - EFS drives: encryption of data
- Encryption Automatically enabled:
    - CloudTrail Logs
    - S3 Glacier
    - Storage Gateway

# Amazon Macie

    - Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events) – for DDoS protection

-------------------------------------------------------

# AWS Fargate
- **serverless** (no EC2 instances), orchestration container service
- run docker containers on EC2 instances
- pay for vCPU and memory resources allocated to your applications in your containers
- same as ECS except you pay-on-demand per running container
- with ECS you have to keep a EC2 running even if you have no container running
- AWS manages the underlying server, so you don't hae to scale or upgrade the EC2 server

# AWS Lambda
- **serverless** functions *(virtual - no servers to manage)* service
- run code *(on-demand)* without thinking about servers *(provisioning or managing)*
- scaling is automated
- easy pricing:
    - pay per request and compute time
    - free tier of 1,000,000 lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
- integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
- **event-driven**: functions get invoked by AWS when needed
- easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
- easy to get more resources per functions *(up to 10GB of RAM)*
- increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network

<br/>

- pay per **calls**:
    - first 1,000,000 requests are free
    - $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)
- pay per **duration**:
    - 400,000 GB - seconds of compute time per month for FREE
    - == 400,000 seconds if function is 1GB RAM
    - == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM
    - After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds
- it is usually very cheap to run AWS Lambda that's why it's very popular
- **language support**: many programming languages except (arbitrary) Docker
- **invocation time**: up to 15 mins
- **lambda billing**: 
    - By the time run x by the RAM provisioned
    - By the no of invocations
- **use cases**: 
    - create thumbnails for images uploaded onto S3
    - run a serverless cron job
