## Regions
Regions are geographically distinct locations consisting of one or more Availability Zones

Every region is physically isolated from and independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply

Each regio has three Availability Zones
- Some new users are limited to two eg. US-West
- New services almost always become available first in the US-EACT
- Not all AWS Services are available in all regions
- All your billing information appears in US-EAST-1 (North Virginia)
- The cost of AWS services vary per region
