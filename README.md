# AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT)
- The AWS Schema Conversion Tool makes heterogeneous database migrations easy by automatically converting the source database schema and a majority of the custom code to a format compatible with the target database. 

- The custom code that the tool converts includes views, stored procedures, and functions. 

- Any code that the tool cannot convert automatically is clearly marked so that you can convert it yourself. 

- For supported source and target databases, see the User Guide, following. 

# AWS Snow Family
- AWS Snow Family are storage and compute devices used to physically move large amounts of data in or out of the cloud
- Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS
- Data Migration:
    - Snowcone
    - Snowball Edge
    - Snowmobile
- Edge Compuging:
    - Snowcone
    - Snowball Edge

*If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices*

## AWS Snowcone
- Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments
- Lightweight (4.5 pounds, 2.1 kg)
- Device used fir edge compuging, storage, and data transfer
- **Snowcone**: 8TB of HDD Storage
- **Snowcode (SSD)**: 14 TB of SSD Storage
- Use Snowcone where Snowball does not fit *(space-constrained environment*)
- Must provide your own battery/cables
- Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use **AWS DataSync** to send data

## AWS Snowball Edge *(for data transfers)*
- Physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
- Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
- Pay per data transfer job

- Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
- High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
- Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB
- Cargo Container filled with racks of storage and compute that is transported via a semi-trailer tractor truck to transfer 100 PB of data per trailer

|    | Snowcone | Snowball Edge | Snowmobile |
| -- | -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Storage Capacity | 8 TB HDD, 14 TB SSD | 80 TB usable | < 100 PB |
| Migration Size | upto 24 TB, online & offline | upto petabytes, offline | upto exabytes, offline |

1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when you’re done (goes to the right AWS
facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped

# Amazon Route 53
- Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs
- In AWS, the most common records are:
    - www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
    - www.google.com => 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 == AAAA IPv6

# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- A web service for **securely controlling access** to AWS services
- centrally **manage** users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.

### IAM: Users & Groups
- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

### IAM: Permissions
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called **policies**
- These policies define the *permissions* of the users
- In AWS you *apply the least privilege principle*: don’t give more permissions than a user needs

### IAM Policies Structure
- Consists of:
    - **Version**: policy language version, always include “2012-10-17”
    - **Id**: an identifier for the policy (optional)
    - **Statement**: one or more individual statements (required)
- Statements consists of:
    - **Sid**: an identifier for the statement (optional)
    - **Effect**: whether the statement allows or denies access *(Allow, Deny)*
    - **Principal**: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    - **Action**: list of actions this policy allows or denies
    - **Resource**: list of resources to which the actions applied to
    - **Condition**: conditions for when this policy is in effect
(optional)

### IAM: Password Policy
- Strong passwords = higher security for your account
- In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
    - Set a minimum password length
    - Require specific character types:
        - including uppercase letters
        - lowercase letters
        - numbers
        - non-alphanumeric characters
    - Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
    - Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
    - Prevent password re-use

### IAM Roles for Services
- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will *assign permissions* to AWS services
with IAM Roles
- Common roles:
    - EC2 Instance Roles
    - Lambda Function Roles
    - Roles for CloudFormation


### IAM Security Tools
- **IAM Credentials Report** *(account-level)*
    -  a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
- **IAM Access Advisor** *(user-level)*
    - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
    - You can use this information to revise your policies.

### IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
- Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM
Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

### Shared Responsibility Model for IAM
| AWS | User |
| --- | ---- |
| Infrastructure (global network security) | Users, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring |
| Configuration and vulnerability analysis | Enable MFA on all accounts |
| Compliance validation | Rotate all your keys often |
| | Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions |
| | Analyze access patterns & review permissions |


# AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On)
- One Login (SSO) for all your AWS accounts in AWS Organizatios
- It provides one place where you can *create* or *connect workforce users* and centrally *manage their access* to **all** of their **AWS accounts** and **applications**.

# Amazon Inspector
- Automated and Continual **vulnerability management** at scale
- Run variety of security benchmarks, can perform both network and host assessments
- For EC2 instances
    - Leveraging the AWS System Manager (SSM) agent

    - IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
- Resource-Based
    - Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
    - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled)
    - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)
- Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if

    - AND there’s no explicit DENY
- Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

## S3 Bucket Policies
- JSON based policies 
    - Resources: buckets and objects 
    - Effect: Allow / Deny 
    - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny 
    - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to

    - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
    - Grant access to another account (Cross
Account)

## Amazon S3 - Static Website Hosting

- If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket
policy allows public reads!

## Amazon S3 - Versioning
- You can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will change the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
- It is best practice to version your buckets
    - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
    - Easy roll back to previous version
- Notes:
    - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
    - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
